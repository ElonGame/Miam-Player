Miam Player is a cross-platform open source music player.

What's inside?
* Read .mp3, .m4a (MP4), .flac, .ogg, .oga (OGG Vorbis), .asf, .ape (Monkey Audio) and more
* Read and Edit lots of Tags using Taglib
* Customize everything: User Interface, Covers, Shortcuts, Buttons, Themes
* Fast and reliable (audio player is provided by VLC Media Player)

A plugin system has been introduced to extend possibilites of the player. Three official plugins come with the installer for Windows:
* Support thumbnails buttons to control the player, green progress bar when playing, overlay icon
* A mini-mode which is a tribute to the good ol' Winamp "shade mode"
* Get missing covers by looking at MusicBrainz' repository

What's next ? Well, whatever you want! Various ideas:
* A spotify / deezer / jamendo plugin to stream music: you have albums 1, 2, 4 on your hard drive. In one click, you might want to listen album 3
* A (scriptable) bitorrent client where you could browse results from your favorite tracker

Right now, what should be improved in this awesome-but-you-dont-know-yet player?
* Create a mechanism to keep the library always up to date (instead of a full rescan)

This software was developped using Qt5 and Taglib
